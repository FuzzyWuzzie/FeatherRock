# FeatherRock

## Story

Ages ago, under a long-forgotten mountain, there lived an ancient race of Dwarves whose name has been lost to time.

These ancient creatures plundered the earth to become wealthy and powerful beyond all measure.

With their accrued power, the dwarves founded a lineage of magical shamans lasting a thousand generations, each more powerful than the last.

The shamans wielded their terrifying magical constructs on the battlefield to wreak destruction on their enemies, ensuring the dwarves' legacy.

That is, until Todd.
